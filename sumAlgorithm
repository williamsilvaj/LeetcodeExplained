The Sum Algorithm takes two integers, $a$ and $b$, as input and returns their sum. The algorithm simply adds the two numbers and stores the result in the variable $sum$. Finally, it returns the value of $sum$ as the output.

The time complexity of this algorithm is constant or $O(1)$, as it performs a single addition operation and has no loops or recursion. Regardless of the input size, the algorithm executes in a constant amount of time, making it very efficient.
